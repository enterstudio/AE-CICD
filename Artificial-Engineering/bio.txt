We at Artificial Engineering try to automate programming as far as possible. We believe that Humans can do more better jobs than programming and are much better at creative tasks and should focus on less repetitive things. We believe that intelligent software bots are better at programming and complicated mathematics. We build intelligent software bots and intelligent tools for a living to the extent that we teach software bots how to write software bots and teach them how to learn from mistakes, identify code repetition and improve our code in a faster and smarter way.

As our story grows, we believe that for future job positions - Humans Need Not Apply.
